# Unveiling Factors Shaping Residential Property Values: Pre-Market Insights

Understanding the key factors that influence the value of houses is crucial for homeowners and real estate stakeholders. The primary goal of this project is to leverage predictive data analysis methods to identify the pivotal factors that significantly impact the prices of residential properties prior to their market listing. By uncovering these factors, homeowners and real estate professionals can make informed decisions and take proactive measures to maximize property values, ensuring optimal returns in the ever-changing real estate market.

## Executive Summary

This project aims to identify the factors that influence residential property prices to assist homeowners and real estate professionals in making informed decisions to maximize property values. The analysis utilizes the Ames Housing Dataset, which contains information from the Ames Assessor's Office regarding assessed values of residential properties sold in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010.

During the cleaning phase, various preprocessing steps were implemented, including converting data formats, feature engineering, handling missing values, imputation, and reducing the number of levels in categorical variables.

Multiple modeling strategies were employed, including linear regression and regularization methods such as LASSO and Ridge. Our preferred model demonstrated high predictive accuracy by employing rigorous variable selection and hyperparameter optimization.

The final models were carefully assessed to ensure they were not overfit, producing comparable results in both the training and test sets.

This project also examined the influence of various elements on property value. The analysis reveals that, in addition to important factors like size, age, neighborhood, and building type, less emphasized factors such as masonry veneer area, porch area, and wood deck area have a significant impact on property value. Conversely, factors like having a fence or a central air system were found to be insignificant in determining property value.

By providing insights into these influential factors, this project empowers homeowners and real estate professionals to make informed decisions for maximizing property values.
